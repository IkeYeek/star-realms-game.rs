# star-realms-game.rs, a Rust implementation of Star Realms
## Why ?
Because I am starting a Deep Learning course at uni and I want to implement the null-sum-games-friendly algorithms we're going to see.
## How ?
It is definitly a not-even-close-to-work WIP, but I aim to have an implementation based on "immutable" states (only mutated in functions that clone the source and return a new muteted state) so I can easily implement the algorithms.
